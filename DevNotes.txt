BUG1:
There's some anomoly occuring that positions the
mouse in the wrong position in ASCII mazes. I'm 
guessing it occurs at the solution stage, but I 
haven't quite figured it out. This can be seen
by loading and solving Maze 1. It occurs with
bith Stack and Queue solutions. 

BUG2:
To display the mouse coords properly for the BIT based
mazes you have to use +2 as the offset rather than +1. 
This can be checked out in the PrintSolution() function 
at line 399.
